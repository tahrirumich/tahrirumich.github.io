      - "Erik Wessel, the director of the Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR), is punishing pro-palestine UofM students for expressing their right to free speech. He needs to drop these unconstitutional charges NOW #GiveItUpWessel #DropTheChargesOSCR"
      - "I thought UofM's Office of Student Conflict Resolution was supposed to withhold justice on campus? Then why is the director of OSCR, Erik Wessel, using the department to target a group of students for pro-palestine protests?? #GiveItUpWessel #DropTheChargesOSCR"
