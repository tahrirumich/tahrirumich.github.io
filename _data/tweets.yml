      - "UofM's OSCR employee Donovan Golich is charging pro-Palestine students AGAIN, trying to sanction and even suspend them for using their right to free speech. Is this what UofM stands for?? @UMichPresGrasso @JordanAckerMI @RegentHubbard #DropTheChargesOSCR"
      - "Why is Donovan Golich trying to sanction UofM students as far as suspension? For expressing their right to free speech? Maybe Golich is the one who should be charged for his bias against pro-Palestine students. @UMichPresGrasso @JordanAckerMI @RegentHubbard #DropTheChargesOSCR"
      - "Pro-Palestine students are being sanctioned by UofM for protesting, and guess who's charging them? Donovan Golich, who already tried to get student degrees revoked for speaking out against genocide in the past. @UMichPresGrasso @JordanAckerMI @RegentHubbard #DropTheChargesOSCR"

      - "UofM's Office of Student Conflict Resolution is trying to sanction pro-Palestine students to the point of suspension. The director of OSCR, Erik Wessel, can stop this injustice, but instead he's pushing for it @UMichPresGrasso @JordanAckerMI @RegentHubbard #DropTheChargesOSCR"
      - "Erik Wessel, the director of the Office of Student Conflict Resolution, is punishing pro-palestine UofM students for expressing their right to free speech. He needs to drop these unconstitutional charges NOW @UMichPresGrasso @JordanAckerMI @RegentHubbard #DropTheChargesOSCR"
      - "I thought UofM's Office of Student Conflict Resolution was supposed to withhold justice on campus? Then why is the director of OSCR Erik Wessel using it to target a group of students for pro-palestine protests?? @UMichPresGrasso @JordanAckerMI @RegentHubbard #DropTheChargesOSCR"
