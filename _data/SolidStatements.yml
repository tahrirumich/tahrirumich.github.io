          >UM Ann Arbor Chapter of the American Association of University Professors Statement Regarding Recent
          Disciplinary Charges Against Student Protesters</strong>
        
        <p>The University of Michigan Ann Arbor Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (UM-AA
          AAUP) is dismayed to learn that the University is bringing new charges against 11 student protesters, including
          undergraduate and graduate students, through the Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR) on the Ann
          Arbor campus.
        
          <br><br>Since November 2023, our AAUP chapter has objected when the University retaliated against student protestors
          with <a href="https://www.aaup.org/news/polarizing-times-demand-robust-academic-freedom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">punishment and policing</a>; 
          made <a href="https://umaaup.org/2024/09/13/in-defense-of-due-process-and-shared-governance/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">unilateral revisions</a> 
          to the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities (SSRR), which diminished or eliminated protections for those facing charges through OSCR; circulated hastily
          drafted policies to <a href="https://umaaup.org/2024/04/08/response-to-the-draft-disruptive-activity-policy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">thwart protest</a> 
          on campus; weakened and undermined commitments to <a href="https://umaaup.org/2024/04/08/statement-on-academic-freedom-in-the-classroom/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">academic freedom</a>; 
          and <a href="https://umaaup.org/2025/04/26/um-ann-arbor-aaup-statement-on-um-employment-terminations-for-workers-exercising-their-first-amendment-rights/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fired workers</a> 
          for exercising their first amendment rights. We are deeply concerned that the University has gone even further to 
          suppress pro-Palestine activism, installing an extensive <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/news/public-safety/michigan-law-aclu-raises-civil-liberties-concerns-over-surveillance-cameras-in-diag-law-quad/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">surveillance camera network</a> 
          and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/06/michigan-university-gaza-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hiring private security</a> 
          to aggressively monitor students and staff. These actions affect all members of the
          University community by chilling speech and civic discourse and by placing people at risk for 
          <a href="https://www.aaup.org/reports-publications/aaup-policies-reports/topical-reports/campus-police-forces" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">racial profiling</a> 
          and other harms. Together, these actions raise important questions about the Universityʼs commitment to due process principles.

          <br><br>In bringing these disciplinary charges with significant delay and using a substantively compromised process (one
          that retroactively applies unilaterally-imposed and off-cycle revisions to the SSRR), the University gives the
          appearance not only of targeting protests against the genocide in Gaza but also of weaponizing the complaint
          process so as to silence any future pro-Palestine activism on campus. Moreover, such actions will likely further
          chill expressions of dissent, regardless of the subject matter. If the University does not require complainants to
          have suffered harm (i.e., they need not have legal standing) and ignores statutes of limitations, then there can be
          no meaningful free speech on campus.

          <br><br>We call on the University to withdraw these disciplinary charges that target students involved in pro-Palestine
          activism. We urge the University to recommit to democratic principles by restoring due process protections in
          student disciplinary proceedings.</p>

        '<strong>UMFAFT-AAUP Statement Regarding Recent Disciplinary Charges Against Student Protesters</strong>
        
        <p>The UMF AFT-AAUP recently learned of new charges being brought against 10 student
        protesters, including both undergraduate and graduate students, under the Office of Student
        Conflict Resolution (OSCR) on the Ann Arbor campus. We are deeply troubled by this news.
        
        <br><br>We live in a time when many are questioning the value and effectiveness of our nation’s
        democratic institutions. As we iterated in our October 9, 2024 op-ed in The Michigan Daily,
        universities must support the democratic fabric of society by cultivating freedom of expression
        and shared governance. Doing so ensures the effectiveness of our public good mission and
        serves as an example of democratic practice for society at large, especially in times like these.

        <br><br>Unfortunately, the issuing of these new charges fits a broader pattern of doing the opposite.
        Since early 2024 we have seen, among other things, an institutional emphasis on punishing
        student demonstrators, sometimes months after their alleged infractions; unilateral revisions to
        the Student Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, including the weakening or elimination of
        protections for those facing charges under OSCR; and the hiring of third-parties to aggressively
        monitor and charge student protesters. While directed at students, these actions affect all
        members of the university community, putting us at risk of surveillance, chilling speech and civic
        discourse, and undermining faith in the university’s commitment to fairness and due process.

        <br><br>We call upon the university to reverse this pattern and to recommit to democratic principles in
        these matters. This, minimally, would begin with withdrawing the recently issued charges
        against student protesters, and refraining from bringing such charges in the future, at least until
        the checks needed to protect freedom of expression and due process are restored to OSCR
        and all other processes affecting student discipline across our three campuses.</p>

        <b><br>Jewish Voice for Peace Academic Council Statement on Charges Brought Against University 
        of Michigan Students:</b>

        <p>Dear Interim President Grasso and University Regents:
        
        <br><br> The Academic Council of Jewish Voice for Peace protests the disciplinary charges 
        now being brought against eleven students by the University of Michigan (U-M) for exercising 
        rights of expressive freedom in support of the Palestinian struggle for survival and human 
        rights. These charges allege disciplinary infractions largely under the new policies for 
        Student Rights and Responsibilities, implemented by the Regents <a href="https://facultysenate.umich.edu/sacua-letter-regarding-student-statement-changes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">over faculty objections</a> 
        last year.

        <br><br>The charges concern four different protests and events that took place in 2024. 
        Many of the students who are charged were victims of the University of Michigan campus police 
        raid on the U-M Encampment on May 21, 2024 at 5:30 AM which sent multiple protestors to the 
        hospital with concussions and broken bones. It is our understanding that, following the failure 
        of U-M to get criminal charges to stick on student and staff activists in the recent past, the 
        U-M Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR) is likely to impose its own sanctions on 
        students. These could range from disciplinary probation to a lifetime ban on re-enrolling at 
        University at Michigan.  Such actions, if left to stand, will have grave implications for these 
        individual students’ futures as well as for the principles that permit protest on campus.

        <br><br>The possibility of OSCR sanctions is especially disturbing in light of other press 
        reports about the U-M Regent-led repression of pro-Palestine students and workers on campus, 
        including: the outrageous firing of Rachel Dawson (which we have <a href="https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/2025/01/14/statement-of-disapproval-dismissal-umich/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">previously condemned</a>); well 
        documented repeated deployment of police violence against protestors, especially with <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/news/news-briefs/breaking-10-7-protest/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">chemical weapons</a>; 
        arbitrary <a href="https://a2independent.com/2024/04/03/u-m-tickets-student-protesters-and-bans-them-from-campus-buildings-aclu-says-not-so-fast/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bans of 60+ individuals from parts or all of campus</a>; 
        the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/06/michigan-university-gaza-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">use of undercover spies</a>

        of at least 12 students and staff who were given no recourse to any due process or appeal; 
        and of course <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/michigan-attorney-general-dana-nessel-campus-gaza-protests" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Guardian newspaper’s report of the Regents’ recruitment of Michigan Attorney General Nessell</a> 
        to pursue criminal charges against young people on campus protesting the genocide in Gaza. 
        It’s clear to us that the U-M Board of Regents has been explicitly dedicated to silencing 
        growing opposition to Israeli state practices that include apartheid and genocide. This 
        is unjustifiable censorship and retaliation against students and staff for exercising 
        basic rights of assembly, association, and expression and standing for a principled 
        objection to state violence.

        <br><br>The Academic Council affirms that speech and activism in support of Palestine—and in 
        opposition to Israeli state oppression of Palestinians-–is neither antisemitic nor 
        tainted by antisemitism. Jewish Voice for Peace, and we as its Academic Council, are 
        committed both to Palestinian liberation and Jewish ethical values beyond Zionism, proudly 
        and without qualification. The members of the Academic Council affirm that these twinned 
        commitments are grounded in Jewish values of social justice and Jewish obligations to 
        respond with support to those suffering from oppression. As a body of scholars–including 
        leading experts on all periods of Jewish history; on Zionism and the history of 
        Palestine/Israel; and on contemporary Jewish plurality–we  affirm that the disjunction of 
        antisemitism and anti-Zionism is  grounded in the established and best scholarship in these 
        areas. The Academic Council thus unequivocally supports the dropping of all charges against 
        the eleven students.

         <br><br>Unfortunately, the Academic Council knows that these kinds of administrative attacks on 
         pro-Palestinian students, staff, and faculty are hardly unique to U-M.  To the contrary, 
         they are becoming increasingly commonplace in U.S. higher education. But this is wrong, and 
         principled administrators refuse to follow this trend that separates universities from the 
         core values of democracy. From fear and self-interest, many university administrators have 
         bent to the will of the Trump administration, which has made federal grants conditional on 
         unconditional fealty to the Israeli state—which means staying silent as that state carries 
         out genocide in Gaza. We call upon the University of Michigan not to engage in this 
         complicity. To do so is to normalize complicity, that is, to ratify the banalization of 
         evil, as Hannah Arendt trenchantly called it.

         <br><br>As a body of faculty and scholars, JVP’s Academic Council calls upon higher 
         education administrators—from chancellors and presidents to deans and chairs—to refuse to 
         become part of a genocidal campaign that works in part through the criminalization of dissent 
         and the stripping of rights for those who have the courage to speak out against it. We demand 
         that the University of Michigan drop all charges against the students.

         <br><br>Sincerely,

         <br><br>Dr. Jonah Rubin, Sr. Manager of Campus Organizing

        'by Communications Chair on July 16, 2025
        
        <p>ANN ARBOR, MI – Last week, the Graduate Employees’ Organization – AFT Local 3550 (GEO) 
        at the University of Michigan, representing over 2,000 Graduate Student Instructors and 
        Staff Assistants, learned that more than ten undergraduate and graduate students at U-M 
        have been charged by the University’s Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR) for 
        their participation in pro-Palestine protests dating back 10 to 14 months. Four of those 
        threatened with discipline are former GEO officers and bargaining team members who have been 
        repeatedly targeted by U-M police and the state. These disciplinary charges clearly 
        demonstrate retaliation against political activism and the further erosion of students’ and 
        workers’ rights on campus.</p>

        <h3><b>OSCR Charges: A Last-Ditch Effort</b></h3>
        
        <p>These charges come shortly after Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s highly publicized 
        criminal charges against student activists collapsed under scrutiny of her clear 
        anti-Palestinian bias. Facing this humiliating defeat, and after revelations that the U-M 
        Regents secretly deployed undercover private security agents to spy on students, the 
        University has resorted to weaponizing its internal disciplinary processes to punish student 
        activists. Shamefully, among those now facing OSCR charges are members of the “Encampment 11,” 
        whose criminal charges were recently dismissed. Despite these activists’ charges being dropped, 
        the University continues to pursue punishment and repression through a rigged internal process.</p>

        <h3><b>Undermining Due Process and Worker Rights</b></h3>

        <p>GEO strongly condemns the Regents’ manipulation of OSCR from its intended restorative justice 
        model into a tool of repression. In July 2024, the Regents unilaterally rewrote the Student 
        Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (SSRR), without consulting any relevant campus 
        community members. These changes effectively eliminated due process protections for students:

        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>The administration can now serve as both complainant and final judge.</li>
        <li>Deadlines for defense preparations have been severely shortened, deliberately limiting 
        students’ ability to defend themselves.</li>
        <li>The Vice President of Student Life, currently Martino Harmon, can override independent panel 
        decisions, guaranteeing predetermined outcomes.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3><b>Broader Context of Repression</b></h3>

        <p>This latest attack on students fits a troubling pattern of repression led by the U-M Board of 
        Regents. Over the last 18 months, U-M has:

        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li><a href="https://www.geo3550.org/2025/05/06/geo-celebrates-mi-ag-dana-nessel-dropping-charges-against-7-of-the-u-m-encampment-11-union-members/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><u>Deployed police violence repeatedly against protesters, including the use of chemical weapons.</u></a></li>
        <li>Arbitrarily banned more than 65 students, staff, and community members from parts or all of campus.</li>
        <li>Fired over a dozen student workers and staff members without due process, enforcing employment blacklists.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/06/michigan-university-gaza-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><u>Hired undercover security contractors to harass student activists, leading to multiple arrests and intimidation.</u></a></li>
        <li>Collaborated directly with Michigan AG Dana Nessel to pursue unfounded criminal prosecutions of protesters advocating for Palestinian liberation.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>These measures are clearly intended to silence growing campus opposition to U-M’s complicity 
        in Israeli apartheid and the ongoing genocide in Gaza—a genocide which has resulted in the destruction 
        of all universities within the territory. <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/news/student-government/central-student-government-debates-divestment-mlb/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><u>Students</u></a>, 
        <a href="https://www.geo3550.org/2024/09/26/geo-divests-from-the-military-industrial-complex-prisons-and-apartheid/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><u>grad workers</u></a>, 
        and <a href="https://facultysenate.umich.edu/senate-assembly-divestment-resolution/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><u>faculty</u></a>
        have long called for divestment from companies facilitating Israeli violence, yet U-M’s administration 
        continues to defend their investments, prioritizing financial interests over human rights. At the same 
        time, they have chosen to spend precious public resources on disciplining students.</p>

        <h3><b>Implications for Student and Labor Activism</b></h3>

        <p>GEO recognizes that these OSCR charges represent a grave threat to freedom of assembly and our 
        collective right to protest. If the University can punish any student at any time for activism 
        undertaken months or even years prior, we effectively lose our right to assemble and organize freely. As 
        we go into contract negotiations this year, we will encounter an authoritarian administration that has no 
        qualms breaking its own rules and deploying violence against the campus community, mirroring the worst 
        tendencies of the Trump administration. The Regents’ blatant disregard for due process and willingness to 
        repeatedly penalize student protesters underscores their determination to crush dissent, whether it relates 
        to their anti-Palestinian policies or their underpayment of graduate workers. GEO is committed to responding 
        to these measures through organizing, activism at the bargaining table and beyond, and continued advocacy for 
        our members’ and their students’ right to free expression. </p>

        <h3><b>GEO’s Demands</b></h3>

        <p>GEO demands that the University administration and the U-M Board of Regents immediately:

        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li><b>Drop all OSCR disciplinary charges</b> against students involved in pro-Palestine activism.</li>
        <li><b>Restore due process protections</b> in student disciplinary proceedings.</li>
        <li><b>End collaboration with undercover security contractors and external political operatives</b> targeting 
        student activists.</li>
        <li><b>Publicly account for U-M’s investments</b> in companies implicated in Israeli apartheid and genocide, and 
        <b>divest immediately.</b></li>
        </ul></p>
        
        <h3><b>Call to Action</b></h3>

        <p>GEO urges the U-M community, other campus unions, and broader public to condemn this ongoing assault on free 
        speech and student activism. It is essential that faculty, staff, alumni, and community allies stand with student 
        protesters in opposing these repressive measures.
        
        <br><br>We further call on the U-M Regents, President’s Office, and OSCR to cease their campaign of harassment and retaliation, 
        restore due process immediately, and publicly reaffirm the university’s commitment to genuine academic freedom, free 
        speech, and human rights.
        
        <br><br>We refuse to be intimidated. GEO stands resolutely in solidarity with all student protesters fighting for Palestinian 
        liberation, and we commit to organizing against all forms of administrative repression.</p>

        <p>The Lecturer Employee Organization explicitly condemns the Universityʼs decision to charge more undergraduate and graduate student 
        protestors with disciplinary infractions through the Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR). The criminal charges against 
        these student protestors have already been dropped by law enforcement. The Universityʼs attempt to still use OSCR to punish these 
        students illustrates a dwindling concern for freedom of speech and due process. These charges are especially concerning as the new 
        OSCR procedures allow the University to act as both a complainant and arbiter against its own students, a conflict that has already 
        led to the University overturning a student juryʼs acquittal of student protestors.
        
        <br><br>As LEO has already pointed out in our statement on September 9th 2024, the Universityʼs manipulation of the OSCR procedures 
        and the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities presents "a chilling repression of free speech, the freedom of assembly, 
        and academic freedom." Therefore, LEO calls on the University to drop these OSCR charges and to bring due process and respect for 
        freedom of speech to the campus conflict resolution process.</p>'

        Conflict Resolution (OSCR) to pursue disciplinary charges against students for protesting the israeli 
        genocide of the Palestinian people. The Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR) claims to be built 
        upon a foundation of restorative justice principles, with the mission statement "Build Trust. Promote 
        Justice. Teach Peace.", yet its punitive prosecution of these students is unjust and exposes a plethora 
        of hypocritical procedures. Restorative justice is meant to repair harm and foster dialogue-not serve as 
        a tool for repression of free speech.

        <br><br><b>By pursuing disciplinary action against these students, OSCR aligns itself with the very systems

        'To our U-M community,

        <p>The date again reads October 7th, but for those of us who still feel, time no longer works as it once did; 
        it now only serves to remind us how <b><i>easily</i></b> the world looks away. The days that pass have become markers, 
        measuring how long the people of Palestine have borne the weight of this world’s injustice.<br><br>
        
        Every single day for the past two years, we have carried that heaviness. We feel it as we walk through the 
        halls of our university, <b>knowing there are no universities left standing in Gaza.</b> We feel it when we return 
        home to our families, knowing that in Gaza, families cling to one another beneath shattered ceilings. We feel it as 
        we sit down to eat, while in Gaza, food and aid are blocked, and <b>starvation is used as a weapon.</b><br><br>
        
        For <b>730 days,</b> Gaza has endured relentless and escalating violence. This violence roots far beyond two years, tracing 
        back to 1948. <b>Seventy-seven years of occupation, seventy-seven years of objective to destroy, erase, and silence us 
        persists.</b> Our brothers and sisters lost. Our homes flattened. Our dreams buried under rubble, all while the world 
        averts its gaze and tries to deny this genocide, disguising its racism by painting us as the aggressors, as 
        terrorists, as if our very existence was a crime.<br><br>
        
        Our so-called world leaders conspire to bulldoze homes and build resorts over the ruins. <b>They distract, distort, and 
        censor-moderating the media whilst silencing the voices of Palestine.</b> They bomb aid convoys and block food from reaching the 
        starving. Even what little aid enters is tainted by cruelty, turned into another weapon against a people already fighting to 
        survive.<br><br>
        
        <b>The University speaks of inclusion, yet it bites its tongue when our identity, our people, and our beliefs are under attack.</b><br><br>
        
        On our own campus, <b>silence is the policy.</b> The University parades and idolizes the student activists of the past in an attempt to 
        conceal that they themselves are the oppressors of our voices. And now, history repeats itself as our activists and our most powerful 
        voices are systematically shut down.<br><br>
        
        All of this unfolds right before our eyes at an institution that not only invests millions into Israel, but an institution that 
        shamelessly <b>weaponizes</b> systems meant to protect its students. The surveillance, the violence from DPSS, UMPD, and AAPD, and the 
        manipulation of OSCR to reprimand students for <b>legal and peaceful</b> protests are all actions we wholeheartedly condemn.<br><br>
        
        We call, we demand, we protest, only to be met with force: pepper spray in our faces, investigations of our names, excessive discipline 
        for daring to speak the truth. With each "violation," they try to teach us that our pain is not allowed, that our resistance is criminal.<br><br>
        
        We carry the weight of our martyrs in our bones. This is not a monument to sorrow, but rather a call to action. We carry not only our 
        pain, but the soul of our people. We resist with our voices, our bodies, our solidarity. We defy the silence demanded of us. We will not be 
        erased. We will stand together unwaveringly. Our struggle for justice is bound to every struggle for liberation.<br><br>
        
        We demand that U-M stop funding this violence, stop policing dissent, and start listening to those it tirelessly regulates. We demand justice, 
        and we demand it now. We stand with Palestine. We stand with every oppressed people. We rise, and we resist.<br><br><b>

        'Dear President Grasso, Mike Ryan, Martino Harmon, Laura Blake Johnes, Donovan Golich, 
        and the Regents of the University of Michigan, 
        We, the members of Shalom Community Church, call on the University to drop the latest 
        disciplinary charges against student protesters pursued through the Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR).

        <p>Shalom Community Church is a Mennonite and Church of the Brethren Christian 
        congregation in Ann Arbor. We hold to traditions of peace and justice and are deeply 
        committed to nonviolent protest. We are motivated by a spiritual conviction that both 
        Israelis and Palestinians are beloved children of God.  Each week we light a candle and 
        pray for both Israelis and Palestinians.
        
        <br><br>It was in this spirit that 14 members of Shalom Community Church responded to the 
        TAHRIR coalition’s invitation to attend a morning sunrise service on May 21, 2024, at the 
        encampment at the University of Michigan. We arrived at about 4:30 am. We gathered in 
        solidarity with Palestinians and in opposition to the unspeakable violence that has been 
        unleashed on Gaza. To speak for a moment on that violence, recently, the premiere 
        scientific journal Nature estimated 80,000 people have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war 
        and some credible sources, such as The Lancet, expect the death toll attributable to the 
        war could rise to nearly 200,000 or more. Currently, people of conscience stand aghast as 
        thousands of children face a slow death by starvation, and as even more thousands of 
        children, apart from profound psychic trauma, face a shortened lifetime characterized by a 
        long list of diseases and health conditions stemming from their prolonged nutritional 
        deficiencies.

        <br><br>On the 21st, we arrived to find a peaceful encampment.  The atmosphere was relaxed and 
        harmonious: students were engaged in quiet conversations and a couple of students were 
        gently passing a  soccer ball back and forth. Most of the students were still asleep. Later we 
        would meet two homeless men who had joined the encampment and noted the spirit of 
        mutual care and community they had experienced.   
        We began worshiping as a small and diverse group that included Christians, Jews and 
        Muslims. In the middle of a poignant sermon, police began to surround the service.  These 
        officers were in stark contrast to the peaceful encampment. They were clad in riot gear and 
        marching in lockstep. They looked prepared for violence. They gave a warning over the 
        loudspeaker demanding that the encampment be cleared in 10 minutes. One of our 
        members captured the end of this warning on cell-phone, and therefore time-stamped, 
        video.  However, even before this ten minute warning had ended, police advanced. Within  
        eight minutes of the initial ten-minute warning, per time-stamped video from the same 
        member, police had begun liberally attacking students with pepper spray. We hardly had 
        time to get all our members out of the area. We were wide awake, and we didn’t have any 
        possessions to gather. Therefore, students were not given enough time to peacefully 
        disperse. This advancement and disbursement prior to the ten-minute window included 
        the invasion of, and shutting down under threat of arrest, our sunrise service. 

        <br><br>We subsequently witnessed police pushing people who were lawfully standing in solidarity 
        with Palestine, knocking people backward over retaining walls, and then using these 
        moments of disequilibrium and vulnerability as opportunities to unleash copious amounts 
        of pepper spray. Police sprayed chemicals, indiscriminately and directly into the eyes, 
        noses, and mouths of people who were standing on the diag in solidarity with Palestine. 
        Several of our members breathed in chemicals and were affected by the spray. The 
        University of Michigan punished solidarity with Palestine by using police repression to 
        violently evict protestors from the diag. To be clear, it was the police who perpetrated 
        violence and attacked campers. Fortunately, the charges against students for activities that 
        day were eventually, and rightfully, dropped. 

        <br><br>We were shocked to hear that the University this month had launched new disciplinary 
        charges against students for actions that allegedly took place 10-14 months ago. For 
        standing up against the horrors taking place in Gaza these students of conscience should 
        be lauded, not punished. We are also upset to hear that joint arbitration has been denied 
        them, a student panel has been denied them, and in sum, authentic due process has been 
        denied them, even though these students are facing life altering consequences. 

        <br><br>We respectfully urge the University and Board of Regents to stop the repression of 
        collective expressions of solidarity. Please immediately drop all of these students’ charges 
        and stop signaling that the University cannot tolerate political discourse and activities 
        people of decency have taken and are taking to bring about an end to horrific violence.</p>

        <p>Until Justice and Peace Embrace,</p>

        million people in Gaza and the West Bank, which the regents of UofM (Jordan Acker, Mark Bernstein, 
        Sara Hubbard, and Denise Illitch) actively support and profit from.
        
        <br><br>The OSCR is a notoriously corrupt department due to the regents’ rewriting of the University’s

        The University of Michigan has initiated more disciplinary charges, including possible suspension, against 
        pro-Palestine protestors  through the Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR).

        <h3><b>DROP THE CHARGES!</b></h3>
        
        <p>The University of Michigan has a long history of targeting pro-Palestine activists as the university regents 
        maintain investments in “israeli” apartheid. In a new round of repression, <b>the University’s Office of Student 
        Conflict Resolution (OSCR) has initiated disciplinary proceedings against 10+ current students and recent alumni.</b> 
        Students are facing various sanctions including possible suspension, and alumni are facing bans from all future 
        interaction with the university.
        
        <br><br>Previously, the regents spent over $750,000 on recruiting outside consultants. Now, they have hired <b>Donovan 
        Golich</b> to act as both the complainant and the investigator, and collaborate with UM police to gather and review selective 
        evidence to criminalize students – completely ignoring numerous conflicts  of interest. Previously, Golich was forced to 
        resign from the University of Virginia, where he tried to revoke degrees from pro-Palestine graduates and verbally abused 
        students in his disciplinary process with foul language and direct threats.

        <br><br>As  Palestinians in Gaza face critical levels of famine, the University of Michigan and universities across the country 
        are pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into investments that enable the genocide in Gaza, and into the surveillance, 
        suppression, and criminalization of protest. The students demand complete divestment from the genocide in Gaza, and as a result 
        have faced felony and misdemeanor charges, FBI raids on their homes, and now further displinary proceedings by OSCR. <b>Just last week, 
        two organizers were subpoenad in connection with the April FBI raids for Nessel’s “multijurisdictional vandlism” case.</b>

        <p>As the pro-Palestine movement continues its struggle against Universities all across the country and their investments in israel’s genocide, 
        the University of Michigan in particular has just launched a new assault of repression.

        HAS JUST CHARGED 10+ PRO-PALESTINE ACTIVISTS WITH SANCTIONS, REACHING AS FAR AS SUSPENSION, FOR THEIR PROTESTS AGAINST THE UM REGENTS AND THE OVER 
        6 BILLION DOLLARS OF UNIVERSITY ENDOWMENT IMPLICATED IN THE GENOCIDE OF GAZA.</b>

        <br><br>This is a continuation of the university’s ongoing assault against pro-Palestine protestors, as the regents have often spent university resources 
        to promote UM police brutality at protests, recruit attorney general <b>Dana Nessel</b> to criminally charge activists, and even hire private investigators to 
        stalk organizers. The regents have spent over 5 million dollars of university funds to wage war on the pro-Palestine movement.

        <br><br>In the ongoing OSCR charges, a recent hire by the regents, <b>Donovan Golich</b>, has taken on the role of both complainant and OSCR investigator in these cases, 
        breaking the UofM’s own rules. Golich went on to state that his goal is to "educate" pro-Palestine activists on the consequences of protesting against the university. 
        Diving deeper reveals his problematic history with student campuses, working as a disciplinary force where he has previously threatened to revoke degrees from 
        pro-Palestine graduates at the University of Virginia, and frequently curses at students.

        <br><br>As israel commits a total blockade on Gaza, leaving over 80% of the population in the final stages of starvation, the University of Michigan continues to empower

        July 21, 2025 / nodetentioncentersmi
        
        <p>The No Detention Centers in Michigan coalition extends our full solidarity to students and alumni at the University of Michigan who face vindictive new disciplinary charges 
        from the Board of Regents as a result of their opposition to Israeli apartheid and the ongoing genocide in Gaza.
        
        <br><br>The U-M Board of Regents has charged eleven current and former undergraduate and graduate students with disciplinary infractions through the Office of Student Conflict 
        Resolution, or OSCR, for alleged participation in protests that took place in 2024. Following the withdrawal of criminal charges brought last year by Michigan Attorney General 
        Dana Nessel, and in the wake of revelations that the university had used undercover private security agents to spy on student activists, the administration is now engaging in 
        retaliatory tactics to target high-profile students, including several who recently defeated those same state-level charges. The University of Michigan Police Department is 
        partnering with a new “Office of Student Accountability” within OSCR to expand punitive measures and to impose guilty verdicts, with students facing sanctions ranging from 
        disciplinary probation to lifetime bans on enrolling at U-M. These measures are part of a broader pattern of repression established by the Board of Regents, which threatens both 
        the futures of individual students and the ability of all students and supporters to engage in protest on campus.

        <br><br>The OSCR charges—which, <a href="https://www.geo3550.org/2025/07/16/geo-condemns-oscr-disciplinary-charges-pro-palestine-student-protesters/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">as organizers have warned</a>, 
        involve a conspicuous absence of due process—arrive at a moment when <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/palestinians-stand-solidarity-anti-ice-protestors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">material links</a> 
        between Israel’s genocide and the authoritarian kidnapping regime of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have become clearer than ever in the public consciousness. In a 
        <a href="https://nodetentioncentersmi.org/2021/06/02/solidarity-with-the-people-of-colombia-and-palestine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">statement of solidarity with the people of Colombia and Palestine</a> 
        published during the 2021 bombing of Gaza, No Detention Centers in Michigan noted that “all movements against oppression and carceral power are connected.” That statement also 
        specifically highlighted the use of administrative detention—imprisonment without charge or trial—by both the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Israeli occupation. The same 
        comparison was drawn this past March by Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, in <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/a-letter-from-palestinian-activist-mahmoud-khalil" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a letter</a> 
        dictated from inside a Louisiana detention center owned and operated by the GEO Group, the company that now profits from a contract with ICE at the reopened North Lake Correctional 
        Facility in Baldwin. Rümeysa Öztürk—a Tufts University doctoral student who, like Khalil, was abducted by federal agents earlier this year because of her advocacy for Palestine, and was 
        held for months in a GEO Group facility—<a href="https://archive.ph/3fwgg " target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">wrote last week</a>: “I am free, but my true freedom is interlinked with the freedom of many women I lived 
        alongside in ICE prison.”

        <br><br>We avow that the freedom of all immigrants is interlinked with the movement for Palestinian liberation, and we honor the students and workers in Michigan and around the world 
        who have fought to raise awareness of their universities’ financial complicity in the destruction of Palestinian life and have pushed for divestment. In the case of U-M, as in many others, 
        <a href="https://tahrirumich.org/research/endowment-guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">investments in venture capital and hedge funds</a> tie the university not only 
        to the Israeli military but also to surveillance systems used by ICE as they extend their anti-immigrant violence further into Lake County and around the state. It is this complicity, not 
        the efforts of students to bring it to light and to change course, that must be resisted. Whether they originate from the Michigan Attorney General’s office or from within the University 
        of Michigan administration, attempts to intimidate, punish, and silence these student activists must end. NDCM amplifies the demands of student organizers at U-M and calls upon the 
        university administration and the U-M Board of Regents to take the following steps:

        <ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Drop all OSCR disciplinary charges</strong> against students involved in pro-Palestine activism.
        </li><li><strong>Restore due-process protections</strong> in student disciplinary proceedings.</li>
        <li><strong>End collaboration with undercover security contractors</strong> targeting student activists.</li>
        <li><strong>Publicly account for U-M’s investments</strong> in companies implicated in <strong>both Israeli apartheid and genocide, and the U.S. detention and deportation machine,</strong> 
        and <strong>divest immediately.</strong></li></ul>

        NDCM is proud to stand in solidarity with all student protesters facing administrative repression for their opposition to settler colonialism and genocide, and we look forward 
        to witnessing both the abolition of ICE and a free Palestine within our lifetimes.</p>'

        <li> End contracts with private security targeting student activists</li>
        <li>End the genocide in Gaza, all U.S. military aid to Israel, and the occupation of Gaza

        </ul>

        <br><br>We call on all campus unions and organizations to pass resolutions of support for 
        the targeted protesters, and to back those resolutions up with workplace actions, with 
        strikes, and with shutting down the University of Michigan campus until our demands are met.

        <br><br>The regents’ first attempt to crush the right to protest on campus failed when Michigan 
        State Attorney General Dana Nessel dismissed all criminal charges on May 5, 2025. 
        Scandalously, regents who donated to State Attorney General Dana Nessel’s political campaign 
        urged her to pursue these criminal charges against students simply for protesting against 
        the genocide.

        <br><br>Nessel dropped the charges under pressure from our movement, because the massive community 
        support for the protesters turned the courtroom into, in her words, a “circus”.

        <br><br>Following the state’s dismissal of criminal charges, the University has now launched new 
        disciplinary charges against students for actions that allegedly took place 10-14 months ago. For 
        standing up against the horrors taking place in Gaza, these anti-genocide activists now face 
        penalties that can include suspension, expulsion, revocation of degrees, and a campus hiring ban.

        <br><br>This latest attempt to criminalize protest against an ongoing genocide not only aids the mass 
        murder taking place in Palestine, but threatens to criminalize any and all campus protest.

        <br><br>We urge all students, university workers, and anyone affiliated with the University or living 
        in Ann Arbor to join this defense campaign.  

        <br><br>Mass strikes, mass protests, and campus shut downs are our most effective tools to fight back against 
        these vicious attacks on basic democratic rights, to end the US government’s arming and funding of 
        the genocide in Palestine, and to end the Trump administraton’s attacks on immigrants and 
        intensifying right-wing, authoritarian actions.

        <br><br>We call on students nationally to organize for a re-launching of mass anti-genocide campus protests this fall, 
        tied to mass strikes by campus and non-campus unions, and mass protests of the wider antiwar movement 
        nationally and internationally. The slaughter in Gaza must end, and we need to go on the offensive against 
        both warmongering parties of the billionaires which have been aiding and abetting this holocaust of the 21st 
        century.

        <br><br>In solidarity,
        <br>Workers Strike Back
