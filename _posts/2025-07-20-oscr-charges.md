**JULY 20, 2025, ANN ARBOR, MI** - The University of 
Michigan Board of Regents have brought disciplinary charges 
against 11 current students and recent alums—including 
leaders of Students Allied for Freedom and Equality, the 
Muslim Student Association, Arab Students Association, 
Jewish Voice for Peace, and Graduate Employees Organization, 
AFT Local 3550—for participation in pro-Palestine protest 
on campus 10 to 14 months ago. Four of those charged are 
members of the Encampment 11, who successfully defeated 
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's criminal charges in 
May. The Regents are seeking formal reprimands, disciplinary 
probation, suspension in abeyance, and, for those who have 
graduated, a lifetime ban from all future activity at U-M.

The disciplinary charges come on the heels of two political 
defeats for the Regents: In May 2025, Attorney General Dana 
Nessel was forced to drop all criminal charges against Gaza 
Solidarity Encampment activists [under the weight of her anti-Palestinian bias](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/05/michigan-dana-nessel-pro-palestinian-protesters) 
and clear overreach. Shortly after, Interim President 
Domenico Grasso was forced to cancel the University's 
contract with CityShield Security after The Guardian 
[exposed U-M's use of undercover spies](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/06/michigan-university-gaza-surveillance) 
to surveil pro-Palestine students.

Now, the Regents are constructing a new office—the Office 
of Student Accountability (OSA)—as the University of Michigan 
Police Department's own private court system. These efforts 
began July 2024, when the Regents unilaterally revised the 
student code of conduct so they could bring complaints, 
control their adjudication, and [determine their outcomes](https://www.michigandaily.com/news/umich-appeals-oscr-hearing-decision-against-pro-palestine-student-protesters/). 
The predictable result has been a 100% "conviction rate" 
against pro-Palestine students, despite both student panels 
and appeals boards finding protestors not responsible for 
policy violations. 

Despite a [federal lawsuit](https://www.aclumich.org/en/press-releases/aclu-and-sugar-law-center-sue-university-michigan-stop-unconstitutional-banishment) 
challenging these practices, OSA is a draconian attempt 
to accelerate and double down on the Regents' agenda to 
retaliate against those who call for divestment. UMPD 
gathers intelligence against students, identifying them 
through the Michigan State Police Biometrics Database, 
then sends the information to Student Investigator Donovan 
Golich, who relies exclusively on police evidence. Golich 
serves as both investigator and complainant—an obvious conflict 
of interest—and even initial resolution coordinator, conducting 
intake meetings to explain the process to students. When at the 
University of Virginia, Golich made headlines in 2024 when [he was recorded threatening fraternity members](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqm0FtrTWzY) 
and was involved in attempts to [withhold diplomas from pro-Palestine students](https://archive.is/h4aNM#selection-4437.261-4437.272).

As israel kills over 100 Palestinians every day and pushes Gaza 
into [catastrophic](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/alerts-archive/issue-97/en/) 
famine, the U-M Regents are creating OSA to silence demands that 
they divest the genocidal Zionist entity. As UN Special 
Rapporteur to Palestine Francesca Albanese's recent report shows, 
there are [60+ major corporations involved in the genocide](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session59/advance-version/a-hrc-59-23-aev.pdf). 
The University of Michigan invests its funds in many of these 
corporations, thus [profiting from the genocide](https://tahrirumich.org/research/endowment-guide). 
As alum Eaman Ali stated, "from the release of Mahmoud Khalil to 
the dropping of criminal charges against our own U-M Encampment 
11, we’ve seen that the challenges of repression only strengthen 
our unity and resolve to see a Free Palestine. We recognize 
repression on a national scale as nothing but a means to distract 
us from the unspeakable horrors and crimes committed against the 
people of Gaza, and we will not be silenced.”
