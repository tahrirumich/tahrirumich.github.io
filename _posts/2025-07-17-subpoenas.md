**JULY 17, 2025, ANN ARBOR, MI** - At 10:00 am on Thurs., 
July 17, two Ann Arbor police officers were sent to the home 
of a TAHRIR Coalition organizer to serve a subpoena tied 
to the recent [FBI raids](https://theintercept.com/2025/06/15/university-michigan-fbi-raid-students-palestine/) on pro-Palestine activists' homes. 
The subpoena was issued by Michigan Attorney General Dana 
Nessel and orders the activist to appear at the Department 
of the AG for “questioning” on July 30. In April, Nessel, who 
publicly presents herself as a Trump opponent, collaborated 
with Trump’s FBI by [requesting](https://theintercept.com/2025/06/15/university-michigan-fbi-raid-students-palestine/) 
they conduct raids on four residences across Canton, 
Ypsilanti, and Ann Arbor in collaboration with state and local 
law enforcement. During the raids, FBI agents and local police 
detained 9 individuals, confiscated electronics and personal 
items, and [broke down the door](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIzC7kMRf4U/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) 
at one residence to force entry after refusing to produce a 
warrant. 

Two hours after the first July 17 visit, in West Bloomfield, 
"special agents" from Nessel's office appeared at the family 
home of an activist who now lives out of state. Agents refused 
to identify their department or affiliation, and – despite 
admitting that they knew the organizer was not present at the 
home – interrogated a family member about their whereabouts. 
On July 18, a special agent left a voicemail with the family, 
revealing that they had a subpoena for the organizer and 
threatening potential retaliation from a judge if they were not 
able to deliver it. AG Nessel, in her [continued collusion](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/24/michigan-attorney-general-dana-nessel-campus-gaza-protests) 
with the University of Michigan Board of Regents to criminalize 
protest demanding divestment, has [vowed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi8c0Ti9qZk) 
to "vigorously pursue charges" in a case of so-called 
“multijurisdictional vandalism” after being [forced to drop all charges](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/05/michigan-dana-nessel-pro-palestinian-protesters) 
against UM activists in early May. 

“Nessel’s efforts to intimidate, target, and silence pro-Palestine 
protesters have serious implications for every Michigander. If people 
cannot speak out freely against Israel’s ongoing human rights 
violations, genocide, and apartheid without facing governmental 
repression, then the freedom of speech of every person in Michigan is 
at risk,” said Liz Jacob, a staff attorney at the Sugar Law Center 
for Economic and Social Justice. Sugar Law is representing organizers 
in ongoing civil cases against UofM’s repression of pro-Palestine 
activists.

These “home visits” are a continuation of the reactionary campaign to 
silence the mass movement for Palestinian liberation. Throughout the 
last 20+ months of ongoing genocide, starvation, and displacement, UM 
Regents have relentlessly targeted, repressed, and surveilled 
pro-Palestine protest through [employing undercover investigators](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/06/michigan-university-gaza-surveillance), 
[criminal charges](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_3Uga-Rier/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), 
[firings](https://www.metrotimes.com/news/u-m-fires-employee-suspends-4-others-over-pro-palestinian-protest-39118764), 
and more. Recently, Regents initiated a third round of disciplinary 
proceedings against students and alumni through the Office of Student 
Conflict Resolution (OSCR) after once again failing to secure criminal 
charges and convictions for multiple pro-Palestine protests. 

“This attempt to isolate individuals through intimidation is a clear 
ploy to fragment the mass movement for Palestinian liberation, 
divestment on campuses across the country, and the demand for a total 
arms embargo nationally. But as we have seen time and time again–from 
Mahmoud Khalil’s release from ICE detention to the charges Nessel was 
already forced to drop–repression only makes us stronger” said Students 
Allied for Freedom and Equality (SAFE), the Students for Justice in 
Palestine chapter at the University of Michigan. “We know that our power 
will always outweigh the state’s, and that as long as the people of 
Palestine remain undeterred in their fight for liberation and return, we 
will take inspiration from them and persist.”

Now, after countless defeats – from the forced [termination of a contract for plainclothes security](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/university-of-michigan-surveillance-students) 
on campus, Nessel’s failed charges, and former [UM President Santa Ono resigning](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJP-TkPRnr5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) 
– UM Regents, in collaboration with AG Nessel & Trump’s FBI, are 
desperate to silence dissent against their material support of genocide. 
We unequivocally condemn the UM Regents’ and Nessel’s attack on the 
popular struggle for Palestinian liberation, and remain unwavering in our 
demands regardless of repression and intimidation. Divest now!
