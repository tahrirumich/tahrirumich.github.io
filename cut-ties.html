            <p>Academic institutions are a key part of the ideological and institutional scaffolding of the israeli regime. 
            Israeli universities provide both <strong>the weapons themselves</strong> as well as <strong>the justification to use them</strong> for the israeli 
            project of apartheid, occupation, and ethnic cleansing. The israeli academy is, therefore, <strong>deeply implicated in the 
            genocide of the Palestinian people.</strong> While the israeli state frames its institutions of higher education as symbols 
            of advancement and modernity, the occupation forces have <strong>destroyed all 12 of the universities in Gaza.</strong> Academic 
            boycotts, even at University of Michigan, have historically been effective against Nazi Germany and apartheid South 
            Africa. It is especially important that we, University of Michigan students, staff, and faculty commit ourselves to 
            an academic boycott as <strong>U of M has numerous ties to israeli universities.</strong> Technion and Weismann, two israeli 
            universities that U of M has long-standing collaboration with, continues to develop several dangerous technologies 
            that are exclusively used for maintaining the Apartheid in the West Bank, and genocide in Gaza.</p>
