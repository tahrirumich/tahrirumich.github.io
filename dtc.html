              >While israel continues its depraved and barbaric 
              campaign of mass bombing, murder, and forced 
              starvation of Palestinians, the University of 
              Michigan Board of Regents continues to prop up its 
              indefensible investments in that genocide through 
              repression.</strong>
             The Regents have now brought disciplinary charges 
            against undergraduate and graduate students for alleged 
            participation in protests that took place in 2024—ten to 
            fourteen months ago—targeting higher-profile students, 
            including those who recently defeated criminal charges 
            pursued by MI AG Dana Nessel. The Regents failed in their 
            attempt to weaponize the criminal-legal system to suppress 
            the popular movement to divest from israel, and are now 
            using the university's Office of Student Conflict Resolution 
            (OSCR) to threaten individual students' futures and 
            destroy campus free speech.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              The Regents are transforming OSCR from a unit dedicated 
              to restorative justice into a tool for authoritarian 
              repression.</strong>
            Vice President of Student Life Martino Harmon has twice 
            overruled "not-guilty" verdicts to sanction students over 
            the past year, resulting in a 100% "conviction rate" for 
            student protestors. Last summer, the Regents broke their own 
            rules for amending the student code of conduct, to make it so 
            that guilty verdicts can now be imposed directly. They 
            recently hired disgraced student disciplinary officer Donovan 
            Golich, who was recorded <a href="https://youtu.be/qqm0FtrTWzY?feature=shared">threatening and swearing</a> 
            at accused fraternity members and acted as complainant in an 
            attempt to <a href="https://archive.is/h4aNM#selection-4437.261-4437.272revoke">revoke pro-Palestine students' degrees</a> 
            in 2024, to act as their "enforcer."
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              The Regents have effectively ended due process, allowing 
              them to sanction any student who stands against them.</strong>
            This is why we must turn to you, our community, to empower 
            those undergoing the repression from UM administration.
            You can directly support by donating to the community legal
            fund, which will be used to run the vital defense campaign
            against these charges. You can also support by using the 
            email zap below to tell the Regents, Interim President Domenico 
            Grasso, and OSCR Director Erik Wessel to drop these politicized 
            charges, cease and desist their vindictive crusade against the 
            anti-genocide movement, and respect students' political speech.
            Lastly, follow us on social media, and we will provide updates 
            on events for us to talk together and strategize further.
